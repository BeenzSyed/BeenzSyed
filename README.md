## Hello hello! :wave: Iâ€™m Sabeen Syed, Engineering Executive & Leader!

I'm passionate about leading with kindness, respect and through inspiring my team. I love being on the bridge between people and engineering. Management requires a deep empathy for every team member and understanding organizations and an understanding of the product and why/what/how we want to build it. I truly believe that happy, healthy organizations can make or break the success of a company.

I'll put an update about my next adventure soon!!
